WE WANT EVERYTHING. 

THE BACKBONE, THE NAME SERVERS, THE SERVICES, THE ROTERS, THE MODEMS, THE SWITCHES, THE INTERCONNECT.

WE WANT EVERYTHING.

If you didnt read the [Eternity Service](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/eternity/eternity.html) paper, please do. We'll wait. Don't worry, we'll still be here when you get back.
